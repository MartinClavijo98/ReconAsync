## Introduction

Reconnaissance is a crucial phase in the security assessment process. It involves gathering information about a target system to identify potential vulnerabilities. ReconAsync simplifies this process by automating tasks such as subdomain enumeration, URL collection, parameter spidering, directory brute-forcing, and HTTP fingerprinting. 

You can start using ReconAsync by downloading the latest release [here](https://github.com/MartinClavijo98/ReconAsync/releases). 

## Features

- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Quickly find subdomains using tools like subfinder and assetfinder.
- **URL Collection**: Gather URLs from various sources to broaden your attack surface.
- **Parameter Spidering**: Automatically discover parameters in web applications.
- **Directory Brute-Forcing**: Use gobuster for efficient directory enumeration.
- **HTTP Fingerprinting**: Identify web server software and versions with httpx.
- **Highly Concurrent**: Leverage Go's concurrency model for faster results.

## Tools Used

ReconAsync integrates several powerful tools to provide comprehensive reconnaissance capabilities:

- **Subfinder**: A subdomain discovery tool that finds valid subdomains for websites.
- **Assetfinder**: Quickly finds assets associated with a domain.
- **Gobuster**: A tool for directory brute-forcing and DNS subdomain enumeration.
- **Paramspider**: A tool for parameter discovery in web applications.
- **Gau**: Collects known URLs from various sources, enhancing your reconnaissance.
- **Waybackurls**: Fetches historical URLs from the Wayback Machine.
- **Httpx**: A fast and multi-purpose HTTP toolkit for probing URLs.

## Installation

To install ReconAsync, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MartinClavijo98/ReconAsync.git
   cd ReconAsync
   ```

2. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/MartinClavijo98/ReconAsync/releases) and execute the binary.

3. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. If not, download it from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

4. Install the required Go tools by running:
   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder
   go get -u github.com/projectdiscovery/assetfinder
   go get -u github.com/OJ/gobuster/v3
   go get -u github.com/devansh123/paramspider
   go get -u github.com/brianwrf/gau
   go get -u github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls
   go get -u github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx
   ```

## Usage

Using ReconAsync is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to run the tool:

1. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   ./ReconAsync -d example.com
   ```

2. The tool will begin subdomain enumeration, URL collection, parameter spidering, directory brute-forcing, and HTTP fingerprinting.

3. Review the results in the console or save them to a file for further analysis.

### Command-Line Options

- `-d`: Specify the target domain.
- `-o`: Output file to save results.
- `--help`: Display help information.
